## My tech Journey

I started my tech journey at a young age of 12

* In 2007 I got my first phone. I started learning HTML and started getting curious about Hacking.
* In 2009 I became better in web design. Started my first blog about hacking tutorials
* In 2011 I started my second blog, https://hackingpalace.net where I became more serious about hacking. In it's peak period it used to have 20K+ views per day.
* In 2012 I leared about backend development, PHP, MySQL etc. I got my first cheque from Google Adsense for advertising in my blog.
* In 2013 During my college studies, I got my first freelance project. I earned 5$ for about a week of hard work (and learning a lot).
* In 2014 I learned Android app development. I took more freelance projects on web development, Apps development etc.
* In 2015 I switched to Linux from linux (permanently!). I learned Node.Js, MongoDB, Angular etc. Took more freelance projects and gained a lot of experience. I started taking care of my expenses and tuition fees on my own.
* In 2016 I started getting bigger clients and bigger projects. I even added a few friends from my college to the freelance projects. I learned about Docker and Docker Compose. Became proficient in Linux server administration. Bigger freelance projects included the responsibility of managing linux servers for the deployments as well.
* In 2017 I did an intership at a startup named **Sensomate Systems** as a full stack engineer. Joined **SAP Labs** as a Backend Engineer (Java) in July. Then switched to full stack role in short time.
* In 2018 I started a freelance work at Avesha Systems. Used to work 2-3 Hours per day in addition to my full time job at SAP. Learned more about Devops and Cloud.
* In 2020 I switched to Avesha for full time. Became a Kubernetes Expert in short time. I designed the initial architecture for the opensource project https://kubeslice.io/
* in 2021 I moved to Germany as a Site Reliablity Engineer at Commercetools.
